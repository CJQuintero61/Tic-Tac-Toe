I made this during my second semester in college to practice my C++ coding skills and to work on my first major project that wasn't tied to a grade of any kind.
I did this as my first major personal project and I wish to continue to make more projects like this that I can show off
to potential employers for when I look for careers and internships. I also wrote a large README at the top of the cpp file that you should also read.
I am always looking for more project ideas that I am capable of doing with my current C++ knowledge, so for now this be left as is unless I do update it for some reason.
Besides that, I will be starting new projects to show off. For now, I don't know what the next project will be, but I'll definitely continue to code.
